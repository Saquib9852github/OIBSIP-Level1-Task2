        A computer is a programmable electronic device that accepts raw data as input
         and processes it with a set of instructions (a program) to produce the 
         result as output. It renders output just after performing mathematical and
          logical operations and can save the output for future use. It can process numerical
    as well as non-numerical calculations. The term "computer" is derived from the 
    Latin word "computare" which means to calculate.
